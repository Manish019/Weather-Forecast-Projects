# Project Title: Weather Forecast Application Development
The Weather Forecast Application is a user-friendly web app that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for any city or location. 
It fetches data from a weather API and displays key information like temperature, 
humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with icons.

✅ Core Features:
🔍 Search City: Users can search for any city to view its current weather.
📅 5-Day Forecast: Displays weather predictions for upcoming days.
🌡️ Real-Time Data: Integrates with live weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
📱 Responsive UI: Works seamlessly across devices with clean, intuitive design.

🧰 Tech Stack (Typical):
   Java Script (for building UI)
  Axios/Fetch API (for API calls)
  OpenWeatherMap API or similar
  CSS / Bootstrap / Tailwind (for styling)
